# Task 6 - Strong Password Creation & Evaluation

## Objective
Understand password strength, test with online tools, and document best practices.

## Steps
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexities.
2. Tested them on Kaspersky Password Checker.com & noted results.
3. Recorded feedback and identified best practices.
4. Researched password attacks.

## Results
- Password `mypassword`: Weak (easy to crack).
- Password `MyPass123`: Medium.
- Password `MyPass@123`: Stronger.
- Password `Summer!2025_CyberInternship`: Very Strong.

## Best Practices
- Use 12â€“16+ characters.
- Mix upper, lower, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid personal info and dictionary words.
- Prefer passphrases.
- Enable MFA.
- Consider a password manager.

## Common Attacks
- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible combo.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reuses leaked passwords.

## Conclusion
Password strength improves with length, randomness, and variety of characters. Using strong passphrases with MFA gives maximum protection.
